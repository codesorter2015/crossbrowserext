# Creating safari extension

If you need to develop extension for Safari, you will go to Safari Dev Center, then clicked "Join Now Free" and it redirects you to the page where you need to purchase apple developer's certificate, which costs $99 each year.

If you try to install safari extension without a safari extension certificate, your extension will only be available until you quit safari.
